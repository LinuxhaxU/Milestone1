<H3>A BIT ABOUT US</H3>
<p>We are a super trustworthy, and not creepy in any way,
company filled with love for green paper. Established in
2015, we gained support quickly and our wonderful
Kool-Aid started changing lives. We want to thank all of
our supporters, even though they aren't with us anymore.<p>

<p>I have a direct line to God and have his explicit blessing
 to create this wonderful drink and bring his sheeple
 back to him in the afterlife.</p>

<p>I am the moral support for the amazing leader that is
my husband. His communion with God is a miracle and 
everyone should be able to take advantage of his divine
greatness. Kool-Aid for the win!</p>
